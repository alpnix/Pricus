# Pricus

Pricus is a web extension that lets you add any item from any e-commerce website and get notified about the price changes to that item. You can also set a threshold option where you specify the rate of reduction of cost for any product and after that threshold is met, it will notify you.

## Features

- **Add any item:** You can add any item from any e-commerce website by clicking on the Price Tracker icon in your browser toolbar and selecting the “Add Item” option. You can also edit or delete the items you have added from the same menu.

- **Get notified:** You will get a notification whenever the price of any of your added items changes. You can also see the current price and the price history of each item in the Price Tracker menu.

- **Set a threshold:** You can set a threshold option for each item, where you specify the percentage of price reduction you want to be notified about. For example, if you set a threshold of 10%, you will only get a notification when the price of the item drops by 10% or more from the original price.
